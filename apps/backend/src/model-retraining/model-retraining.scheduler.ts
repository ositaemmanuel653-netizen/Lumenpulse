/**
 * NestJS-side scheduled trigger for model retraining.
 *
 * Fires daily at 02:30 UTC — 30 minutes after the Python scheduler's own
 * 02:00 UTC job, acting as a redundant fallback in case the Python process
 * missed its window (e.g. restart, cold start).
 *
 * The Python service submits retraining to its async job queue (#1248) and
 * collapses concurrent duplicate submissions onto whichever run is already
 * in flight, so double-triggering is safe. The advisory lock here prevents
 * multiple NestJS instances from all firing the fallback simultaneously.
 * `triggerRetrainingAndWait` polls the job queue instead of holding a
 * single long-lived HTTP request open for the duration of the run.
